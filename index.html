            <p>The reason for the massive market decline is growing panic surrounding the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) and the effect it has had on major economic players like China. According to John Hopkins University's coronavirus tracking
              map, there are nearly 90 thousand known cases of affected people in China. There are currently 791 in the United States.</p>

            <p>On March 9, the Dow Jones declined by 7.79 percent by the time Wall Street rang its closing bell. This marks the largest single-day decline since 1987.</p>

            <p>The steep market decline resulted in a 15-minute trading halt, which hadn't happened since 1997. According to NPR, the blue chip index fell nearly 7.8 percent and the S&P 500 dropped 7.6 percent. A 15-minute halt is automatically
              triggered any time there is a 7 percent drop in the S&P 500 index. It was apparently set off by Saudi Arabia's steeply-discounted oil prices.</p>

            <p>When investment falls at least 20 percent or more from its 52-week high, it is described as a "bear market." While the American markets are flirting with this designation, they're not there yet. As of Monday, Japan and Australia's
              markets are. </p>
